Ray Trace Renderer for Blender

Using BRLCAD library rt to provide mathmatically accurate images, hopeing
to create a CAD engine within Blender for ease of use.

Engineers, after they graduate, may face a problem of expensive tools
to do their job, in terms of cost of machines and software(s). Being honest,
without computers we are as effective as if we were in the 1900s.
Thereby, a lightwight package that can help an engineer is greatly
apprechated.

BRL-CAD claim to be a CAD software used in the 1980s to provide analysis of
different machines. However, knowing the computation constrains back in the
day, it was well optimized. So using later computers may work even on a weak
workstation.
It dose suffer, in my openion, ease of use. The interface is not acceptable
in today's standers. Tcl/Tk and X display systems are classic, thou developed
for CAD use.. I could not get my head through it. Instad of continuing
developing it UI, why not integrate it into an existing package?

Blender is an artist tool, though, being opensource, you can make it do
what you want, if you have the life time. So I decided to make a renderer
for Blender to use it, POVray acts simller to what we are trying to atchive
and lux render have a great way to port it.

Wish me luck to finish my milestone!
